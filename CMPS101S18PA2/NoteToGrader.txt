My approach: 

I focus a good portion of the project learning C's syntax, primarily on how data structures are implemented and C, 
designed my ADT similar to the First Assignment (using an Doubly Linked List). Since this was my first program in C, I decided to watch several tutorials C's syntax which took up a few days. I then read up on how to implement Abstract Data Types in C with special emphasis on pointers. I also figured out through a few hours of debugging that by specifically casting an alias on "typedef struct Elea * APInt" actually hides from the data structure from main. This is demostrated when I this:

 gcc APInt.h APInt.c demo.c
demo.c: In function ‘main’:
demo.c:34:29: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘struct Elea’
  printf("%d\n", (*number_1) -> head -> value);

The following are tutorial's I utilized in order to build my code (Source):
