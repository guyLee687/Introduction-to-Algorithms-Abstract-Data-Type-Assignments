Approach: 

My approach to the problem involved using polynomial accumulation in order to generate a 
series of unique number and mod it by a prime number times the size of the wordList. The base
for my polynomial accumation is 5 and is raised to the power of the letter ranking in 0-25. I found 
the following concept in the notes below

I also used LinkedList in order to handle my collisions and stored my set of anagrams in an array inside
an array of LinkedList.
